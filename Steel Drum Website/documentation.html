        Here, you will see our process of developing this steel drum program!
      At first, we looked up how steel drums even functioned in the first
      place, such as which places make what sound or what range of sound they
      can make.

      <p>
        In this step, we started to draft up different ways we could build the
        drum as well as how we could perhaps make the sounds. This is when we
        came up with the sounds we have now.
